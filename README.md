It works exactly how its named! Open your calculator app, add and subtract different big numbers and give those numbers as input to this program and it'll find which numbers you added and which you subtracted!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* ****** How to Use ******
	* Step 1:
	* Use your calculator and add and subtract few numbers
	* Eg: 100+400+500+600+700+800+900+1000+200+300-500
	* 
	* Step 2:
	* Provide these numbers one by one to the program or simply provide it as a list
	* 
	* As a list: 100,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000,200,300,500
	* 
	* One by one: 100 [Press Enter] 400 [Press Enter] and do it until the last one
	* 
	* Step 3:
	* After that, Press X to goto the next step.
	* Then give the total value that comes after you add and subtract those numbers.
	* In my case, its 5000
	* [Press Enter]
	* 
	* It will attempt every possibility and tries to find your answer
	* After that, it'll provide you the equation: 100+400+500+600+700+800+900+1000+200+300-500
	* 
	*

Update: It doesn't let you input wrong numbers because it can now detect how many possibilities
can be attempted and if the equation doesn't even come after trying all the possibilities, it'll
throw it as an input error.
